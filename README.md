# few-shot-CANlrp

This code is based on the [fewshot-CAN](https://github.com/blue-blue272/fewshot-CAN) repo. 

We add the explanation-guided training and the lrp explanation module. The training hyperparameters are the same as [fewshot-CAN](https://github.com/blue-blue272/fewshot-CAN).

To train the explanation-guided models, please run the [trainlrp.py](./trainlrp.py) file. 

To visualize the attention and lrp heatmaps, please run the [LRPnet.py](./torchFewShot/models/LRPnet.py)
